   - Has website → Other angles (admin pain, speed, etc.)

3. **Trade Context:**
   - Plumber/Heating → May mention boiler parts
   - Electrician → May mention wiring
   - Builder/Construction → May mention CIS/VAT
   - Default → Generic materials

4. **Pain Point Variety:**
   - Admin pain (late nights)
   - Forgetting materials
   - Typing difficulty
   - Time efficiency
   - Professional output
   - VAT/CIS automation
