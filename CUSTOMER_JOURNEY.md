# YapMate AI - Customer Journey & Billing Guide

---

## 1. Step-by-Step Customer Journey

### Step 1: Downloading the App
- You download **YapMate AI** from the App Store
- The app is free to download
- No payment information is required at this stage

### Step 2: First Launch
- When you open YapMate for the first time, you'll create an account
- You're automatically on the **Free plan**
- You can start creating invoices immediately using voice commands
- The Free plan includes 3 invoices total

### Step 3: Using the Free Plan
**What you get:**
- 3 invoices (total lifetime limit)
- Voice-to-invoice recording
- PDF downloads
- Basic invoice features

**What you don't get:**
- VAT support
- Reverse Charge calculations
- CIS deductions
- Customer list storage
- Unlimited invoices

**When you reach 3 invoices:**
- You'll be prompted to upgrade to continue using YapMate
- You can choose between **Pro** or **Trade**

### Step 4: Starting a Free Trial
**To start a trial:**
1. Tap **"Pricing"** in the app settings
2. Choose **Pro (£15/month)** or **Trade (£25/month)**
3. Tap **"Start 7-Day Free Trial"**
4. Apple will ask you to confirm with Face ID / Touch ID
5. Your trial starts immediately

**What happens:**
- You get instant access to all Pro or Trade features
- Apple stores your payment method but **does not charge you** for 7 days
- You can cancel anytime during the trial at no cost

### Step 5: During the Trial (Days 1-7)
- You have full access to your chosen plan (Pro or Trade)
- Apple will send you a reminder 24 hours before the trial ends
- If you cancel before Day 7 ends, you won't be charged
- If you don't cancel, your subscription starts automatically on Day 8

### Step 6: When the Trial Ends
**If you didn't cancel:**
- On Day 8, Apple charges you £15 (Pro) or £25 (Trade)
- Your subscription becomes active
- It will auto-renew every month unless you cancel

**If you cancelled during the trial:**
- You drop back to the **Free plan**
- No charge is made
- You keep any invoices created during the trial
- You can start a new trial later if you change your mind

### Step 7: How Upgrades Work
**Upgrading from Free to Pro or Trade:**
- You can start a 7-day free trial first, or pay immediately
- Access to new features is instant

**Upgrading from Pro to Trade:**
- Tap **"Upgrade to Trade"** in the Pricing page
- Apple will calculate a pro-rated charge for the current month
- For example: if you're 15 days into your Pro subscription, you'll only pay for the remaining 15 days of the difference (£10)
- Your next full billing cycle will be at the Trade price (£25/month)

### Step 8: How Cancellations Work
**To cancel your subscription:**
1. Open **iPhone Settings** (not the YapMate app)
2. Tap your **Apple ID** at the top
3. Tap **Subscriptions**
4. Find **YapMate AI**
5. Tap **Cancel Subscription**

**What happens when you cancel:**
- You keep access until the end of your current billing period
- For example: if you cancel on Jan 10th but paid on Jan 1st, you have access until Jan 31st
- After that, you drop back to the **Free plan**
- Your invoices and data are kept
- You can re-subscribe anytime

## 2. Billing Explained

### Who charges me?
**Apple charges you directly.** YapMate does not process payments. Your subscription appears as "YapMate AI" on your Apple receipt.

### Where do I manage my subscription?
All billing is managed through **Apple's Subscriptions** in your iPhone Settings. This includes:
- Viewing your current plan
- Cancelling your subscription
- Changing payment methods
- Requesting refunds

YapMate cannot cancel, refund, or modify your subscription—only Apple can.

### How do refunds work?
Apple handles all refunds. If you're within your trial period, simply cancel before Day 7 ends and you won't be charged.

If you've already been charged and want a refund:
1. Go to [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Find your YapMate subscription
4. Request a refund

Apple reviews refund requests on a case-by-case basis.

### Why does Apple handle payments?
- **Security:** Your payment details stay with Apple, not with us
- **Simplicity:** One subscription system for all your apps
- **Trust:** Apple's refund protection and privacy guarantees
- **Compliance:** Meets all UK and EU regulations automatically

6. Cancelled subscription ends → Drops to Free (data retained)
