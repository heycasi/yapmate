## How Free Trials Work

1. **Start Trial:** Tap "Start 7-Day Free Trial" on the Pricing page
2. **Confirmation:** Apple asks you to confirm with Face ID / Touch ID
3. **Trial Period:** You get instant access to all plan features for 7 days
4. **Reminder:** Apple sends you a notification 24 hours before the trial ends
5. **After Trial:** If you don't cancel, you'll be charged on Day 8 and your subscription begins

**To cancel during trial:** Go to iPhone Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions → YapMate AI → Cancel Subscription. You won't be charged if you cancel before Day 7 ends.

## How Subscriptions Work

- **Auto-Renewal:** Your subscription renews automatically every month unless you cancel
- **Billing:** Apple charges you directly. YapMate does not process payments
- **Access:** You keep access until the end of your current billing period, even if you cancel mid-month

**Example:** If you subscribe on January 1st and cancel on January 10th, you'll have access until January 31st.

## Upgrading or Downgrading

- **Free → Pro or Trade:** Start a 7-day free trial, or pay immediately
- **Pro → Trade:** Apple calculates a pro-rated charge for the remaining days in your current billing cycle
- **Trade → Pro:** Downgrade by cancelling Trade. You'll drop to Free at the end of your period. Then subscribe to Pro.

1. Open **iPhone Settings** (not the YapMate app)
