# How YapMate Billing Works

## Managing Your Subscription

### How to Cancel

1. Open **iPhone Settings** (not the YapMate app)
2. Tap your **Apple ID** at the top
3. Tap **Subscriptions**
4. Find **YapMate AI**
5. Tap **Cancel Subscription**

### What Happens When You Cancel

- You keep access until the end of your current billing period
- For example: if you cancel on Jan 10th but paid on Jan 1st, you have access until Jan 31st
- After that, you drop back to the Free plan
- Your invoices and data are kept
- You can re-subscribe anytime

## Upgrading or Downgrading

### Free → Pro or Trade

You can start a 7-day free trial first, or pay immediately. Access to new features is instant.

### Pro → Trade

1. Tap **"Upgrade to Trade"** in the Pricing page
2. Apple will calculate a pro-rated charge for the current month
3. For example: if you're 15 days into your Pro subscription, you'll only pay for the remaining 15 days of the difference (£10)
4. Your next full billing cycle will be at the Trade price (£25/month)

### Trade → Pro (Downgrade)

To downgrade from Trade to Pro:
1. Cancel your Trade subscription in iPhone Settings
2. You'll keep Trade access until the end of your billing period
3. Then you'll drop to Free
4. Subscribe to Pro when ready

## Refunds

Apple handles all refunds. If you're within your trial period, simply cancel before Day 7 ends and you won't be charged.

If you've already been charged and want a refund:

1. Go to [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Find your YapMate subscription
4. Request a refund

Apple reviews refund requests on a case-by-case basis.
